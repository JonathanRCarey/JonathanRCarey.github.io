    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Hello! My name is Jonathan Carey and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My interest in coding dates back even as a young child. I always had a passion for gaming and, through that, I came to learn about coding as a whole. Initially, I wanted to code and create a game myself, though perhaps that may still be the next step for my future.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After doing some research on the subject, I ended up participating in a number of entry level coding camps in order to learn the basics before I went into high school and got my first real taste of Html, Css, and more. As of now, I am currently attending Eleven Fifty in the hopes that I am able to learn various website creation skills that will aid in me finding a job in the future.</p>
